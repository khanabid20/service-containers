# 01_02-service-containers
Use these files to test a service container.

1. Create a new repo.
2. Add the files from this directory to the root of the new repo; note there may be a .gitignore file that is hidden...add that file as well.
3. Move the file `service-container.yml` into the `.github/workflows` directory in the new repo.
4. Once the file is commited, the workflow should be triggered by a `push` event.
5. Confirm the workflow runs as expected and includes output for a step named `Initialize containers`.
